# Probabilistic mineral prospectivity modelling with TAGI, BNNs, and MC Dropout

This repository contains the code and resources for the article "Probabilistic mineral prospectivity modelling with tractable approximate Gaussian inference."

# Installation and setup

To reproduce the results presented in the paper, please follow these steps:

  1. We used Git LFS to store the data cube we used.
       * Download and install Git LFS from the official website: https://git-lfs.github.com
       * After installing, run the following command in the terminal to initialize Git LFS:
         ```git lfs install```
         
  2. Clone the repository
       * Clone this repository, and Git LFS will automatically detect the pointer file and download the large ```data.zip``` file during this process. This may take some time.
    
         ```git clone https://github.com/Laish93/probabilistic_mpm.git```
    
  3. Install dependencies
       * Install all the required Python libraries listed in the provided ```requirements.txt``` file.
